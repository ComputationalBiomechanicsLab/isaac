## ‚ö° Quickstart for existing users (Windows) <a name="quickstart"></a>

This assumes you already went through the [walkthrough](#walkthrough) below and
just want to reconnect:

- Open a terminal
- Run `ssh -L 59000:localhost:<your vnc port> username@isaac.3me.tudelft.nl`
- Type in your password (**remember, you can't see it being typed in**)
- Open your VNC client (VNC Connect, TightVNC Viewer, etc.) on your Windows machine
- Use your VNC password to connect

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Note**
>
> - If you don't remember your user password, you'll have to ask an admin to reset it for you
> - If you don't remember your VNC port, you can restart your VNC server with `bme_vnc-restart`
> - If you don't remember your VNC password, you can reset it via your SSH session with `bme_vnc-passwd`


## üö∂ Walkthrough (Windows - you're a new user) <a name="walkthrough"></a>

This walkthrough sets up:

1. Using `ssh` to connect a terminal to `isaac`
2. Launching a personal VNC server on `isaac`
3. Opening an SSH tunnel to the VNC server
4. Setting up a VNC client on your computer
5. Using the VNC client to connect to your VNC server via the SSH tunnel

---
### 1. Connect to the server with SSH <a name="walkthrough-step-1"></a>

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Note**: this assumes you already have SSH credentials
>
> - An isaac admin will give you a `username` + `password` combo. The combo differs from your TU Delft credentials
> - Once you have logged into `isaac.3me.tudelft.nl`, you can change your password in the terminal with `passwd`

All connections to `isaac.3me.tudelft.nl` must go via an SSH tunnel. SSH is a
standard method for creating a secure connection to a remote machine. By "SSHing"
into a server, you gain access to a remote terminal on `isaac` that you can use to
run things on it. You always need an SSH connection to connect to `isaac` - even
if you ultimately plan on using VNC to forward a remote GUI desktop. 

**To set up an SSH connection to `isaac.3me.tudelft.nl` on a Windows machine**:

- Open a Windows PowerShell window

  - SHIFT + right-click on your Windows desktop

  - Click "Open PowerShell Window Here"

- SSH into the server with your login credentials by typing `ssh
  YOUR_USERNAME@isaac.3me.tudelft.nl`

- Enter your password. **Note: you can't see anything being typed while typing
  your password in (it's a security feature)**

- You should now have an SSH connection to `isaac.3me.tudelft.nl`. It will print a
  welcome message, etc.

- If you only need  terminal access, you can stop reading this
  walkthrough - you're done :smile:

---
### 2. Boot a VNC server on `isaac` <a name="walkthrough-step-2"></a>

A VNC server is a piece of software that runs hosts a GUI desktop on
a machine (here, it'll be hosting a desktop *from* `isaac`). A VNC
client is a piece of software that connects to VNC servers and
presents the remote desktop to a user.

Each user on `isaac` hosts their own VNC server within their user account,
which means that you can reset it, keep it running overnight while your
laptop is turned off, change the password, etc.

**To set up a VNC server on `isaac`**:

- In your SSH session (established above) run `bme_vnc-start`. If
  necessary, type a new VNC password. You can change the password
  later with `bme_vnc-passwd`.

- The `bme_vnc-start` command should, before completing, print your
  VNC server's details. **You should note down**:

  - The VNC password you set
    - **this is different from your SSH password**
    - It is limited to 6 characters
    - It does not need to be secure, because your VNC connection
      always goes via your (secure) SSH connection
  - The VNC server's port, printed in the terminal (e.g. `6901`)
    - The `bme_vnc-start` should print this in a large banner, or some
      explanation text

After running `bme_vnc-start`, your VNC server should now be running on
running on `isaac`. Remember, though, that the only way to connect to it
is via an SSH tunnel (isaac's and TUD's firewalls only permit the SSH
connection), so we need to set up a tunnel.

---
### 3. Setup a SSH tunnel to the VNC server <a name="walkthrough-step-3"></a>

`isaac` only allows external connections via SSH. All services
(e.g. VNC) must connect via an SSH tunnel. This step sets up a tunnel
through the SSH connection through to the VNC server you booted in the
previous step.

**To setup an SSH tunnel for your VNC client on isaac**:

- (If your SSH session is still open in a terminal), exit your existing
  SSH connection to `isaac` by either:

  - Typing `exit` in the terminal (to `exit` the SSH session)
  - Pressing CTRL+D to interrupt+exit the terminal
  - Closing the Powershell window

- Open a new SSH session to `isaac` with tunelling enabled by running
  the command below (note: `<your VNC server port>` is printed during
  the previous step):

```bash
ssh -L 59000:localhost:<your VNC server port> YOUR_USERNAME@isaac.3me.tudelft.nl

# example: ssh -L 59000:localhost:6901 adam@isaac.3me.tudelft.nl
```

- Your terminal should now be connected via a new SSH session to `isaac`. It will
  look identical to your previous SSH session, but it now *also* tunnels that you
  make to `localhost:59000` on your machine to `<your VNC server port>` on `isaac`.

---
### 4. Install + setup VNC client on your machine <a name="walkthrough-step-4"></a>

To connect to the VNC server you booted on `isaac` in previous steps, you'll need a
VNC client. This walkthrough outlines using TightVNC which, while barebones-looking, is
functional and open-source.

> Note: Previous versions of this guide used VNC Connect. This guide is essentially the
> same as the previous versions, but was switched to TightVNC because of license concerns.

**To install a VNC client on your computer**:

- Download TightVNC from: https://www.tightvnc.com/download.php
- Install it
- Open it up, it should present a UI where you can enter a `Remote Host` etc.

---
### 5. Use the client to connect to the VNC server via the tunnel <a name="walkthrough-step-5"></a>

Once you have a VNC client, you need to boot it up and connect to `isaac` **via the ssh
tunnel**, so that you can then remotely control `isaac` via a remote desktop.

**To connect to your VNC server on `isaac` with the VNC client on your computer**:

- In your VNC client, connect to `localhost:59000`, which is the
  local-side of your (opened in the previous step) SSH tunnel to your
  VNC server (also a previous step) on `isaac`

- If you receive warnings about connection security (e.g. encyption)
  you can ignore these. The connection between the VNC client and
  `localhost:59000` is insecure, but local (to your machine). The
  actual data is transported via the (encrypted) SSH tunnel, which is
  secure - the VNC client doesn't "know" that's whats happening.

- Use your VNC password when connecting to the machine with the VNC
  client.

  - Note: you can change your password in the SSH session with
    `isaac_vnc-passwd`

  - Note #2: VNC passwords are usually max. 6 chars, so your usual
    password might've been truncated

- Once connected, you should see a (somewhat rough-looking) Linux
  desktop

## F&Qs

## Q: How do I create my own Conda Environment?

A: You can either:

- **If you're using a remote GUI desktop via VNC**:
  - Open `anaconda-navigator` via a terminal
  - Click `Environments` on the left-side in Anaconda Navigator
  - Create a new environment
  - Ensure your new environment is activated
  - All applications booted via the navigator should then use your new environment

- **If you're using a terminal (e.g. via SSH)**:
  - Ensure you have initialized `conda` for your terminal: `conda init` (reopen your shell with `exit` etc.)
  - List available python versions with `conda search python`
  - Create it via (e.g.) `conda create --name your_envname  python=3.8.18`
  - Activate it via `conda activate your_envname`
  - Test it with (e.g.) `python --version` (should print `Python 3.8.18` if following the other example commands)


## Q: How do I setup OpenSim Python Scripting?

A: The easiest way to use the OpenSim API via Python is to use a conda
environment as they outline [here](https://simtk-confluence.stanford.edu:8443/display/OpenSim/Conda+Package). The
conda forge page for the package, where you can find more information, is [here](https://anaconda.org/opensim-org/opensim).

These steps must be performed in a terminal (Anaconda Navigator was being extremely
iffy about it):

```bash
# BEFORE STARTING, SEE: https://anaconda.org/opensim-org/opensim/files to figure
# out which versions of python are supported by opensim

# add conda-forge channel
conda config --remove channels conda-forge

# create relevant conda environment that can use OpenSim
conda create --channel conda-forge --name my_env_name python=3.11.5

# activate the environment
conda activate my_env_name

# install opensim into the environment
conda install -c opensim-org opensim

# test that it works (should print OpenSim's version to the console)
python -c "import opensim; print(opensim.__version__);"
```

You can then use `my_env_name` (or whatever you called it) in the terminal, or
activate it via Anaconda Navigator (the problems I encountered were only during
installation).
